## Horse Meadow [Credit : JVD]

These are the most common mistakes people are making.

1)  _**Why does my horse never level up?**_
**A**:  Your horse isn't leveling up because it is gaining in breeding effects instead of BASIC ATTRIBUTES.  IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.  If you aren't sure, hover over the icon on the wheel.  Only 3 are Basic Atrributes, and 6 are breeding effects. Basic Attributes are the larger icon version of Strength, Agility and Endurance.

2) _**So where do I find my breeding effects?**_
**A**: Your breeding effects are found in the stable.  When you first open the stable, the green tab at the far right will be lit up that says DETAILS.  You need to choose the third tab which says COOPERATIVE MEADOW.  Here you will find your breeding effects

3) _**I have tons of breeding effects from the Meadow.  Why does it seem like my horse still isn't getting anywhere?**_
**A**: This is perhaps because you are choosing breeding effects of show jumping, dressage, and racing.  Or +Jump Power, +Elegance, and +Speed.  

It takes FOUR of these to equal just ONE breeding effect of +strength training, +agility training, or +endurance training.  OR +strength, +agility, or +endurance.

First I pick the best gene pool.  131 is the best this time   https://prnt.sc/iyjs8u

Then I put the sliders down in show jumping and endurance  https://prnt.sc/iyju5g

Then pull up the slider on the Basic Attribute (large icon) of Agility https://prnt.sc/iyjv58

Any remaining points go on breeding effects of +endurance (small icon) https://prnt.sc/iyjwhx

Then click on the big heart button below to breed.  I have 100% chance of leveling up in Agility, and 31% chance of aquiring +1 in endurance training

- **first priority** in building a strong horse is to go for the Basic Attributes (large icon) of Strength, Agility and Endurance.  Our Meadow limit is level 200, so please don't get locked out of the Meadow by leveling up to 201.

- **Second priority** are the breeding effects (small icons) of +strength training, +agility training, and +endurance training.  These can be found in the Cooperative Horse Meadow tab in the stable.

**Knowing the difference between Attributes and effects are key.  :-)**

These combos will increase your horse basic attributes easily and you must do them in the correct order as given:

 - **Combo 1**: Brush, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Blanket. (4 items) Basic **Attribute of Agility.**

 - **Combo 2**: Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Brush.(5 items) Basic **Attribute of Endurance.**

 - **Combo 3**: Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Sugarcube, Jumping Obstacle, Hoofpick, Brush. (6 items)  Basic **Attribute of Strength**
